## Revisers Design

The design of the **Reviser!** Was done by the Following below:

- **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with providing the Used with a clean brigh friendly them that does cause any obstruction to the interface causing the user to feel very lossed in whats happening on the Screen. That is why for better design for each xml screen interface a drawable Background Image was added instead od using colours as the backhround.
- **Responsiveness**: Reviser!Was coded to respond efficiently allowing the user to easily swap eash array string after they click the Next Question button and move onto the next set Question.
- **Simplicity**: Design is simple and clean. Eacjh of the TextViws are organised properly to avoid any errors while the App is running inside of the Emulator.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## What improved and Enhanced Application features can be added to the specific Application

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description, e.g., "Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description, e.g., "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description, e.g., "Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]

## Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment

In the development of this project, I have used generative AI tools to assist in various parts of the assignment. Below is a detailed disclosure of where and how these tools were used:

### 1. **Section(s) in which Generative AI was used:**
- **Question 2.2**: Used AI for brainstorming ideas for the app's features.
- **Part 5**: Assisted in creating code snippets for setting up GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Part 3**: Used AI to help improve the grammar and clarity of the report.

### 2. **Name of AI Tool(s) Used:**
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **GitHub Copilot** (GitHub)

### 3. **Purpose/Intention Behind Use:**
- **Brainstorming**: Used ChatGPT to generate ideas for the app’s features and functionality.
- **Meaning Making**: Used AI to clarify some concepts and gain a better understanding of how certain technologies (e.g., GitHub Actions) work.
- **Initial Investigation**: Utilized AI to conduct research on best practices for Android app development and GitHub Actions setup.
- **Code Assistance**: GitHub Copilot was used to assist in writing specific parts of the code, such as setting up GitHub Actions and working with Gradle.
- **Correcting Grammar and Spelling**: ChatGPT helped review and correct the grammar and clarity of my project report.

### 4. **Date(s) in Which Generative AI Was Used:**
- **Question 2.2**: AI used on **March 5, 2025** for brainstorming feature ideas.
- **Part 5**: AI used on **March 8, 2025** to help set up GitHub Actions.
- **Part 3**: AI used on **March 10, 2025** for reviewing the final report.
